## Other Helpful tools
### [Hardhat Contract Sizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-contract-sizer) 
    Displays the contract size for all or a selection of your smart contracts in kilobytes. The limit for a smart 
    contract is roughly 24.5 kb, so this is a good tool to use to figure out if we need to cut down on the smart 
    contract size. 
    Install: yarn add --dev hardhat-contract-sizer
